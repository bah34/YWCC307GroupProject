Group Project Prompt:
  The infusing of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math is the new initiative set forth by the Department of Education. 
  Your team is involved in designing a new iSTEM lab for a school district. Your team is preparing an analysis for a district about
  a new potential lab in the district. Research the current state-of-the-art products on the market and make a case for the new lab.

   Here at Stensborg, STEM education is incredibly important to our progress. The VR and AR capabilities on offer
   provide new insights into the world of nanomaterials and spectrometers; “A VR laboratory experience was designed 
   to teach students how to use an infrared spectrometer and elucidate an unknown structure from the resulting infrared spectrum.”

      The NYU Tandon VR app, called Tandon Vision, takes prospective students on a virtual trip to Mars with a robot built by the
      school’s Lunabotics student club while evoking the institution’s many alumni astronauts and NASA engineers. 
      (Astronauts Lee Morin, Charles Camarda, and Paolo Nespoli all went here.)
